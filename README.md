### Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to do this as well? 
---
### Using the Kickstarter data file, analyze the outcomes based on the goal, and the outcomes based on the launch date
---
---
## Outcomes Based on Goal
---
### 1. There were 350 plays in the data file
---
### 2. There were 258 (74%) successful plays, 88 (25%) failed plays and 4 (1%) canceled plays.
---
### 3. The majority of the successful plays (95%) had goals less than $10,000. 
---
### 4. There were 7 plays with goals >$15,000, and only one was successful, meaning that plays with bigger golas have a low probability of success.
